# petwings python - A Python Shooting Game
## Introduction
[petwings](http://www.saitogames.com/petwings/) was a game developed by [SAITO Game Studio](http://www.saitogames.com/index.htm) in Japan. 
It was once extremely popular in 2000. I love this game very much, so I create a simplified version of petwings with python. I hope you enjoy it, too.

Yeah, they have created an Android version of petwings!)
